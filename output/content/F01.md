[Create an OCDS release](../operations#create-a-release) for each `/OBJECT_CONTRACT` (*Object*) element. (If the notice is for prior information only, then this element is repeatable in [present forms](http://simap.ted.europa.eu/documents/10184/99173/EN_F01.pdf), but may not be in [future forms](https://github.com/eForms/eForms/issues/55).)
